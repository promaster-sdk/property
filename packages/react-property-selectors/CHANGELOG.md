## [Unreleased](https://github.com/promaster-sdk/property/compare/@promaster-sdk%2Freact-property-selectors@9.1.0...master)

## Changed

- Remove readonly and optional arrays of property names and instead include boolean properties on the PropertyInfo object for isReadonly and isOptional, see PR [#41](https://github.com/promaster-sdk/property/pull/41).
- Change the API of the properties-selector so that instead of sending a dictionary of property formats, you send in a callback that will provide the format for a property, see PR [#40](https://github.com/promaster-sdk/property/pull/40).
- Removed `fieldName` prop, see PR [#39](https://github.com/promaster-sdk/property/pull/39).

## [v9.1.0](https://github.com/promaster-sdk/property/compare/@promaster-sdk%2Freact-property-selectors@9.0.0...9.1.0)

## Added

- React as peer dependency.

## [v9.0.0](https://github.com/promaster-sdk/property/compare/@promaster-sdk%2Freact-property-selectors@8.1.0...9.0.0)

## Changed

- Moved all legacy component based selectors to the `@promaster-sdk/react-properties-selector` package. Legacy applications must now reference those selectors from that package instead.

## [v8.1.0](https://github.com/promaster-sdk/property/compare/@promaster-sdk%2Freact-property-selectors@8.0.0...8.1.0)

### Added

- `useAmountFormatSelector()` better compability with <Select> in material-ui by not relying on `select.selectedIndex`.

## [v8.0.0](https://github.com/promaster-sdk/property/compare/@promaster-sdk%2Freact-property-selectors@7.0.0...8.0.0)

## Changed

- Added generic DiscretePropertySelector hooks and removed specific hooks for Checkbox, Combobox, ImageCombo, RadioGroup.
- All discrete selectors now share a single hook.
- Move hook for usePropertiesSelector from package react-properties-selector to package react-property-selectores. Now all hooks are in the same package and the react-properties-selector package is deprecated.
- You can pass any items to the hooks. It now uses callbacks to extract data from your items. This means you can use any extra data you want in the items and use that during rendering.

### Added
